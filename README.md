# test-macropi

This is a repo set up for 

- testing the shiny app at https://fredbec.shinyapps.io/test-macropi/

- testing / getting feedback on the repo structure in itself


The folders contain the following:

- forecasts: quantile forecasts in the proposed format for the final repo. Currently, only contains one .csv file with forecasts from Spring 2022, for illustration purposes. 

- extra-data: historical time series values for the shiny app. Since these contain direct values of the IMF WEO forecasts, they should probably not appear in the final public version of the repo (also just for 'cleanliness').
